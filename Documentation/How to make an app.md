### How to make a custom app

Step 1 create the app using the andromeda file and the penguin mod editor to create the app and all of its sprite (make sure the the icon is going to the storage variable x and y 

Step 2 download all of the sprites and zip them up

Step 3 upload the zip files to a github page or some other file hosting website

Step 4 Go to the andromeda **COMPILED** file and submit the app data

Step 5 Refresh and check the app store to see if it worked if it didnt take the app down (IF WE SEE YOU HAVE A GLITCHED APP WE WILL BAN YOU)
